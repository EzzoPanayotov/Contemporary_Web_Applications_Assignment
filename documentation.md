## Introduction

Searching for information can be very frustrating and time-consuming for students, especially students that have just started university.

Of course, with experience and time, gathering information becomes easier; however, it can be very overwhelming at the beginning.

Tutors are usually very busy people, which means that receiving an email with an answer could take some time; of course, students are too; however, students are more likely to answer quicker due to their number.\
An answer from a student would not be of the same quality as the one from a tutor, most likely, but it could provide the questioner with a general idea.

As mentioned in the first assignment, the data accumulated through a survey shows that students struggle to find general information about their modules.\
During the first assignment, a prototype of a forum for Solent University students was produced.\
For this assignment, the prototype was followed, and a demo version of the product was created.

The forum allows students to create posts containing their questions, and other students will be able to provide answers, make suggestions or give recommendations in a comment section.
