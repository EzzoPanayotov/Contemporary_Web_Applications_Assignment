## Introduction

Searching for information can be very frustrating and time-consuming for students, especially students that have just started university.

Of course, with experience and time, gathering information becomes easier; however, it can be very overwhelming at the beginning.

Tutors are usually very busy people, which means that receiving an email with an answer could take some time; of course, students are too; however, students are more likely to answer quicker due to their number.\
An answer from a student would not be of the same quality as the one from a tutor, most likely, but it could provide the questioner with a general idea.

As mentioned in the first assignment, the data accumulated through a survey shows that students struggle to find general information about their modules.\
During the first assignment, a prototype of a forum for Solent University students was produced.\
For this assignment, the prototype was followed, and a demo version of the product was created.

The forum allows students to create posts containing their questions, and other students will be able to provide answers, make suggestions or give recommendations in a comment section.

## Methodology

User stories were used to understand the requirements for the project, and the MoSCoW prioritization method was used to sort them.\
A user story describes the features of a system or software that will be useful to the user or purchaser (Cohn and Beck 2011, p.4).\
MoSCoW is an abbreviation of four hierarchical priority groups:
- "***MUST*** have": requirements that the project has to have.
- "***SHOULD*** have": features that are not vital but would be nice to have.
- "***COULD*** have": nice to have features that will have a small impact if not included.
- "***WON'T*** have": features that are not going to be prioritized now, maybe at a later stage.

#### Methods

The solution was evaluated by a representative user base (students) through an online questionnaire.\
The users had not used nor seen the application before they used it to get their truthful impressions and feedback.\
The data gathered shows the following:
- Some users found the design of the application inconsistent.
- The users approved of the demo application's navigation.
- Users were able to figure out the functionalities of the application fairly easily.
- Some users were able to find visual and functional errors.

Each user gave an overall grade of the solution.
| **User**   | **Grade**   |
| :--------: | :---------: |
| User 1     | 8           |
| User 2     | 7           |
| User 3     | 5           |
| User 4     | 5           |
| User 5     | 6           |
| User 6     | 5           |
| User 7     | 4           |
| User 8     | 6           |
| User 9     | 5           |
| User 10    | 6           |

|**AVG of Overall Grade**|
|:---:|
| 5.7|

The average of the overall grade is 5.7 out of 10, which means that there are places where the solution can be improved.
To improve the solution, we need feedback from the clients (students), which we already have, and change the priorities using MoSCoW.

## Conclusion/Results

The development process went pretty well, even though some functionalities were not implemented.\
There was not enough time to implement the unimplemented functionalities due to errors and research required to complete some operations.\
I had some trouble using ***"useEffect"*** hooks, one of the errors that occurred was an infinite loop, which caused 50K(50,000) reads in firebase in a matter of no time.\
